# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:24-alpine AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files
# .npmrc is included for registry/proxy settings
COPY package.json package-lock.json .npmrc ./

# Install all dependencies (including devDependencies)
# Use --frozen-lockfile equivalent (npm ci) for reliable builds
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
# This runs 'tsc -b && vite build' as defined in package.json
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built assets from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the custom Nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
